"Introduction
Throughout East Asia, anti-feminism has become a more politicized and virulent movement, fueled by a backlash against gender equality and enabled by social media. Japanese and South Korean feminism is deplored by its critics as threatening tradition and social harmony, and is regarded by its supporters as a long-overdue fight for justice and representation. Feminist voices in China are censored or penalized regularly, illustrating the dangerous cost of dissent. This cultural tension permeates all levels of society, from education and domestic to political to online. In order to halt the spread of the anti-feminist movement, real change must come from the top. Only by changing the government's legislation and stance regarding feminism through activism can we reduce the abuse that women receive at the hands of anti-feminists and kill the anti-feminist movement for good.
Getting Involved
The best way to first get involved in the fight against the anti-feminist movement in these East Asian countries would most likely be to begin following social media trends in these countries to get a better feeling for how people in them feel about this issue. Aside from being able to see popular hashtags related to feminism, oftentimes anti-feminists use social media to attack and harass women, allowing us to get a grasp on how they operate. Then, another way to get further involved in the issue would be to establish relationships with feminist allies within these societies. These allies might include feminist organizations, branches of government that support gender equality, or similar groups. Through these groups, we can learn firsthand the difficulties that Asian women face in society, how they are affected by the gender disparity and the anti-feminist movement, as well as what measures they have been taking to combat it and fight for their rights.
Understanding the Issue
Upon connecting with feminists and monitoring social media, it’s essential to gain a beyond surface-level understanding of the issue. This means going beyond what’s trending and diving deeper into the cultural, political, and historical factors that fuel the backlash against the feminist movement. For example, historically Japan has seen multiple anti-feminist movements following the rise of women’s rights legislation and gender equality movements. (Kawasaka 2023) Given the success of the MeToo and similar movements, and that economic hardship and competition for work have given rise to some young men with resentment, laying blame on their condition at the door of feminism. Looking into how media and politicians talk about feminism can also show how deeply the issue is misunderstood or intentionally twisted. By learning about the specific challenges women face in different countries—whether it’s a lack of workplace protections, gender-based violence, or being silenced online—it will lead to a much stronger position to advocate for meaningful change.
Planning
	To create real change at the institutional level, it is essential to analyze what actions would be able to influence the government the most. In these countries, a significant reason why anti-feminist beliefs have been propagating is the government’s indifference to them, or worse, their support. In China, government institutions have denounced feminist opinions as extremism, and in South Korea, former president Yoon Suk Yeol ran a campaign based on appealing to anti-feminist ideology and promising to remove the Ministry of Gender Equality. (Ahn 2022) Given how pervasive these beliefs are in the governing bodies, something like petitioning lawmakers to provide stronger legal protections for women against harassment or outright denouncing anti-feminism should be examined carefully, as it is important to determine which politicians would be the most susceptible to activism, what sympathies they might have and which people to spearhead these institutional pushes.
Advocating
Once one is sufficiently prepared and has critically analyzed the parties to target, protect, and the information necessary to support their actions, swift advocacy is key. In order to push for feminist policies in the government, support from public officials and lawmakers is necessary. Therefore, in advocacy, one must reach out directly to people in positions of power, possibly through writing letters, attending town halls or public consultations, or arranging meetings with policy advisors. It may also be possible, with the support of local feminist organizations, to directly submit formal policy recommendations. With officials in positions of power, it’s essential to emphasize the damage the movement has done to women and the abuse that they have suffered. South Korea’s deepfake videos can be used as a key example of this, where misogynists and anti-feminists have created AI-generated pornography of young women and children’s likeness, to the point where many women no longer keep personal images on their social media accounts. (Sang-hun 2024) As it stands, the government continues to enable the anti-feminist movement to spread their hatred and harassment, so only through ensuring that support for feminism and women comes from the highest level can this movement be eliminated.
Evaluating
	Even after a successful campaign or push for policy change has been made, it is also important to evaluate the effectiveness of the actions taken to determine whether they indeed made a difference. Success can be evaluated by comparing how public officials responded, whether policies were implemented or supported, and whether there was any measurable reduction in the anti-feminist rhetoric or harassment faced by women. This can also be measuring whether feminist voices are being heard increasingly in government decision-making or whether there are fewer occurrences of online hate speech and gendered attacks. Monitoring social media reaction, media attention, and opinion surveys can offer feedback. If the campaign involved collaboration with feminist groups or international allies, collecting their input will be crucial. A success rarely demonstrates immediate results either, it could be incremental victories, such as a public official acknowledging anti-feminism as a problem, or more funding for gender studies. If the advocacy was a failure, the evaluation allows one to determine what the possible mistakes were, whether through poor communication, targeting the wrong authorities, or misjudging the political timing, and adjust future activities in light of this.
Ongoing Monitoring
	Even when measurements show that positive change is taking place, advocacy does not end with the success of an objective—it evolves. Vigilance is required in order to ensure that anti-feminism does not resurface in a new form or continue to spread unchallenged. This involves staying ahead of legislative changes or shifts in public opinion, especially if there are elections or national events of consequence. Governments that appear pro-gender equality this year can easily switch sides next year depending on popular sentiment. Social media monitoring remains highly necessary as anti-feminist ideologies tend to resurface on social media, where they are harder to monitor and police. Close contact with local feminist movements and allies will provide insight into the real-time situation, and if there are new dangers to gender equality, whether in the form of legislation that silences feminist voices or an escalation of harassment campaigns on social media, activists must be ready to act fast. Only this time, the knowledge on how to deter the anti-feminist movement will be readily available.
Conclusion
	The fight against East Asian anti-feminism is not a cultural debate—instead, it is a battle against structural inequality and injustice. Hoefer's Unified Model of Advocacy Practice illustrates that change needs to be informed, strategically planned, and checked on regularly in order to be long-lasting. This backlash illustrates society's anger at changing gender roles in an era of globalization and digital pressures. To overcome this movement, society must advocate for change visible in the very institutions that all people rely upon, and the government must recognize the damage that this ideology causes to its citizens. Only through persistent and compassionate work can the movement towards gender equality overcome anti-feminism and redefine the future in these countries. (WC: 1278)"
"Why Pro-Liang’s Push For Asian Equality Upholds White Privilege
           	While I support the Black Lives Matter movement in the case of Officer Peter Liang, I also acknowledge the valid concerns regarding racial disparities in sentencing; however, the Pro-Liang movement seeks to uphold and assimilate societal white privilege through their use of racial victimology based in antiblackness, when we should be demonstrating solidarity for the African American community and mourning the loss of an innocent life at the hands of police incompetence and attack the white-centric state that disproportionately discriminates against minorities.
           	I would argue that the argument based on the difference in punishment between White and Chinese officers widely used in support of Peter Liang is an example of the perpetuation of White Privilege and the belief in “Multicultural Redemption” for Asian Americans.  The idea of “Multicultural Redemption” is the narrative of different races becoming one with universal through upward mobility and financial success. However, this redemption is often only viewed through the white lens, where whiteness becomes the standard for success, and assimilation into a white lifestyle is the only reference for success and could be considered an example of whitewashing. Sugino draws upon this idea heavily in their critique of the hit movie Crazy Rich Asians, claiming that “the feelings of whites become the standard by which inclusion is judged, naturalizing white enjoyment as the boundary for apprehending acceptable forms of pro-Asian discourse.” (Sugino 11) When we examine the perspective of Liang supporters with this in mind, it becomes readily apparent that the claim that Liang should be let off easy because white officers were given lenient punishment stems from the Asian idea of equality stemming from whites. For them, for there to be justice, Liang must also possess white privilege and not face the consequences of killing an innocent black life, when it should be the other way around. For there to be true justice, white officers must be punished as harshly as Liang.
	With the idea of “Multicultural Redemption” being heavily white-centric, it’s no surprise that this belief continues to perpetuate antiblackness in our society, an aspect readily apparent in the defense of Peter Liang and seeking racial justice through “white” success. Antiblackness is what comes hand in hand with white privilege, and is the force that frames blackness as dirty and inferior to uphold whiteness as universally desirable, an issue not limited just to white society. Sugino also examines this ideology in her condemnation of Crazy Rich Asians, as she exposes how the film devalues darker-skinned Asians when Peik Lin says that “the Youngs came to Singapore in the 1800s when there was ‘nothing but jungles and pig farmers.’” and Sugino explains that “the language of ‘jungles and pig farmers’ calls on colonial imagery of Singapore and its indigenous inhabitants as uncivilized and backwards, devaluing them in comparison to the wealthy, sophisticated and British-educated Young family.” (Sugino 12) This along with white privilege-based multicultural redemption is one of the driving forces behind the defense of Officer Liang’s actions, where Asian Americans consciously or unconsciously seek to assimilate privilege and justice that white Americans possess. In doing so, they demean the value of black and darker-skinned Americans by placing them inherently at the bottom of the societal pecking order as an undesirable class and a position to be avoided. This dynamic is further exemplified in the mobilization of Asian American activism in response to Liang's conviction, where racial victimology plays a central role. 
	Following the Peter Liang case, Asian American activists and their leaders moved to protest his seemingly unjust punishment, gathering en masse and fostering a powerful movement centered around Chinese unity. In this movement, one of the tactics they utilized was racial victimology, aiming to steer BLM’s attack on the racial injustice of police violence toward racism against Chinese Americans. In Complicity and Resistance: Asian American Body Politics in Black Lives Matter, Wen Liu documents the subsequent Asian American movement after the conviction of Peter Liang. Liu found that the “Liang incident becomes another classic example of how Asian Americanness is lifted up to perpetuate model minority success in order to deny the institutional access of other marginalized racial subjects such as in the affirmative action debate.” (Liu 431) Liu saw how Asian American leaders attempted to preserve the model minority myth at the expense of other minorities, aligning them with the white oppressors and white privilege rather than trying to tear down the unjust system built upon antiblackism and racial injustice. In contrast to these harmful narratives, history provides examples of multiracial solidarity that offer a more constructive path forward.
	When attempting to build a countermovement against the overwhelming tide of the Pro-Liang campaign founded on misguided multicultural redemption, we must center our efforts around a sincere multiracial kinship through examples given by prior generations of activists. In giving a display of solidarity from Asian Americans to African Americans, the movement aims to unite one another as groups that are victims of state-enforced white supremacy and combat the model minority stereotype and pursuit of whiteness. Soon after Peter Liang’s conviction, Asian American groups held a vigil for Gurley’s family, an event which saw a “diverse group of individuals”, an event which Liu compares to a case in the 1990s where an immigrant Chinese boy, Yong Xin Huang, who was killed by NYPD in the 1990s, and how the incident bridged activists across racial lines: ‘Black and Brown communities were the first ones there for the Huang family”. (Liu 437) Similar to historical displays of Afro-Asian solidarity, to build a movement rivaling Pro-Liang’s we must shift the focus away from tearing one another down to coming in arms against the oppressive state that disproportionately gives leniency to police officers, especially white ones. 
The Peter Liang case serves as a powerful example of how racial victimology and misguided appeals to white privilege undermine genuine efforts toward racial justice. By aligning Asian American struggles with white supremacy instead of challenging them, movements like Pro-Liang inadvertently perpetuate antiblackness and the model minority myth. Moving forward, Asian American activism must reject the pursuit of “Multicultural Redemption” and instead center solidarity with Black and Brown communities. Through multiracial kinship, Asian Americans can honor Akai Gurley’s life and work toward dismantling the systems of oppression that disproportionately harm marginalized people. True justice lies not in assimilating whiteness, but in collectively fighting for accountability, equity, and liberation for all."
"The Great Chinese American Divide
It’s no secret that Chinese Americans and other multicultural groups tend to have mixed feelings about their heritage and ancestors, often with respect to their family and how they were raised versus the society they grew up in. For Chinese Americans, there’s a cultural gap between them and mainland Chinese, or even their parents, from the difference in language, traditions, cultures and beliefs. In order to assimilate with the new society they live in, sometimes cultural differences clash head to head and it often feels like you have two sides pulling you apart in opposite directions. Not to mention that each Chinese American might differ in viewpoint regarding their culture, ranging from disdain for their heritage to reverence. This class taught me that my values differ strongly from traditional Chinese American ones. Due to my upbringing, even though I still value things like family, I value my independence the most and don’t take much interest in spiritual rituals.
Traditionally, Chinese don’t necessarily have a common religion like Christianity or Islam, instead having an undefined folk religion of values, traditions, and rituals deriving from several different belief systems. The lack of a concrete definition for this unique case has led to some people dubbing it the incredibly thought-provoking name of “Chinese Popular Religion”. “Chinese Popular Religion” holds strongly the values of ancestor veneration, family loyalty, and the righteous spirit, and these beliefs manifest themselves in rituals like burning incense for the ancestors, burning fake money for the departed, and other superstitions/spiritual practices. As a second-generation Chinese American, I grew up practicing some of the traditions of “Chinese Popular Religion”. My viewpoint is similar to Erica Tseng's in Family Sacrifices, as she “believes in fate and karma and wears a Buddha pendant, she states that she is non-religious. One reason is that, unlike her Christian friends, she ‘doesn’t feel so deeply about one thing that is not tangible.’” (Jeung Ch.4) Similar to Tseng, I find it hard to feel strongly about something intangible like religious beliefs and I don’t strongly believe that my ancestors will answer my prayers or watch over me. However, unlike Tseng, I don’t particularly believe in fate or karma, possibly because though my parents practiced Chinese Popular Religion, they were not overtly enthusiastic enough for me to become strongly attached to these types of things. 
	However, unlike Chinese Popular Religion, the idea of Chinese religious skepticism is an idea that applies more to my life. Chinese religious skepticism refers to the fact that Chinese Americans have a strong tendency towards nonreligious beliefs, with around half of Chinese Americans identifying as “religious nones”. Family Sacrifices attributes the source of this religious skepticism to Chinese Popular Religion and the Chinese emphasis and beliefs of familism providing values and a system for Chinese to abide by. When I was younger, I used to have a similar view as Scott Lai, the atheist who doesn’t believe “ in the existence of an ‘omni-three’ God. That’s kind of the Abrahamic tradition of the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent. . . . I don’t really believe in a spirit as any kind of independent entity without a physical form.” (Jeung Ch.1) These skeptical views most likely came from my parents not being particularly religious themselves and my developing a keen interest in science from a young age. As I grew older these beliefs became less harsh, as I developed more of an apathy to the spiritual and religious rather than Lai’s strong skepticism. 
	Despite his atheistic beliefs, Lai does note that even though he may not share the spiritual beliefs of his family, he is dedicated to providing for them, a theme common across the entire spectrum of religious belief in Family Sacrifices. Like Lai, for many Chinese Americans familism is the ultimate value that they hold important, in which family serves as a purpose of life, a sense of belonging, identity, and generally their reason for living. It is a family-centric ideology that draws from Confucianism and Chinese Popular Religion and some of its key aspects are the prioritization of family above all else, even personal desires and needs, reciprocity and loyalty to the family, and respecting your ancestors. Craig Quan is a strong example of this, emphasizing reciprocity in his vow to take care of his parents even in old age. “I would never put my parents in a nursing home. I’d have them live with me. My sister is on the same page. [This is important because] they take care of me, and I take care of them. “ (Jeung Ch. 5) I also recognize the importance and place of familism in my life, but unlike Chinese Americans who might find it to be a source of their strength it feels more like a burden or an unbearable pressure more than anything else. This burden has led me to strive for independence above all else and put myself in a position in which I can live my own life free of anyone else’s expectations.
Chinese and Chinese Americans demonstrate the importance of family in their lives through the practice of table traditions, which are the way Chinese are supposed to act at the dinner table. An example of a common table tradition would be the tradition of the youngest serving tea for the eldest first, demonstrating the value of respecting the elders. Another might be how the Chinese haggle or fight for the bill, an act of demonstrating respect and taking care of each other. Diana Ngai acknowledges the significance of these practices and practices these traditions to show her care and love, saying “And there is also [this pattern] because you genuinely love your aunt, uncles, and cousins, and if you don’t do it, then you’re not reflecting how much you care for them. You want to make the most of the time you have since everyone is getting older and show that you care.” (Jeung Ch. 6) In comparison, I have also seen and practiced my fair share of table traditions from having dim sum with family, most notably pouring tea for the elders as the youngest, something that I grew up with. However, I’ve never been big on them, and from what I seen, my Chinese family members seem to be lenient to children and Chinese Americans. Not to mention, the constant fighting over the bill and overly polite exchanges have at times frustrated my grandparents and parents, and I hear them complain about them frequently."
"Prompt 1 Answer 
When examining this situation, there are several key stakeholders to keep in mind.	 First is yourself, as the programmer of your method that you are pushing to production without undergoing sufficient testing protocol. Second is the user, who would bear the effects of this action. Even though you may be confident your method is correct and that it has no effects on other parts of the program, you can never be certain, especially when working with code. If your code does contain a bug that slipped through, the users might experience this bug in the form of incorrect data processing or worse. The third major stakeholder would be the company, as they would be held directly liable for allowing such code to slip through, and bear the ramifications of any possible bugs that it creates. In this scenario, I would advocate for going through the necessary specifications and review process before implementing your method.
As software developers, we are always responsible for maintaining quality coding standards, as our work is an integral part of modern society. As a developer working on processing data from wearable fitness devices, one person’s code can possibly affect all users of the fitness device. Thus it’s important that we take the time to test and review all code implemented, no matter if we personally think that it’s perfect and isolated. When working with large-scale projects involving whole companies and their massive codebase, it’s better to assume that one person could possibly miss an oversight and that we need multiple people to review the code to possibly find areas in which we missed. This is an important tenet of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, where software developers must “ensure that specifications for software on which they work have been well documented, satisfy the users’ requirements, and have the appropriate approvals.” (Baase and Henry 533) The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice is the practice that all programmers should seek to abide by, and it highlights the fact that the software that we work on should have the appropriate approvals. Should we decide to ignore the approval process, we neglect the very principle that all software developers should abide by. 
The origin of this principle is quite simple: in history, software failures have been a result of inadequate testing. And these failures have had genuine effects on the users of said software, resulting in consequences even risking people’s lives. An example of software failure due to insufficient testing would be the case where an air traffic collision prevention system was insufficiently tested, meaning that when it was first released for public aircraft use, it “had so many false alarms that it was unusable. In some incidents, the system directed pilots to fly toward each other rather than away, potentially causing a collision instead of avoiding one.” (Baase and Henry 472) Here, we can clearly see the effect that the lack of proper testing protocols has. In this scenario, it could have potentially cost the lives of the passengers and the pilots if they had not been careful, and at best was just spewing useless information. It is important that software development follows rigorous testing and review phases in order for scenarios like this to not happen, lest our careless bugs cause real damage to our users. Furthermore, there is no urgency or need for our software to be pushed immediately. Our project is focused on data processing from fitness devices, a relatively low-impact project. Should our project have been something that could genuinely have a widespread significant positive impact on the users and the society, something that could genuinely save lives, then there might be some point in trying to implement this method as soon as possible. However, our software is simply improving the processing of user data, meaning there’s not much reason to try to rush it into use, so the better thing to do would be to just go through all the testing procedures. After all, “preventing use of a bad product is better than relying on after-the-calamity remedies.” (Baase and Henry 474)
In conclusion, the importance of following proper testing protocols and review processes in software development cannot be overstated. As programmers, we bear a significant responsibility to ensure the safety and quality of our code, as it directly impacts users, companies, and society at large. The potential consequences of neglecting these processes, as evidenced by historical examples like the air traffic collision prevention system failure, highlight the critical need for thorough testing and approval. In this specific case, where the stakes are relatively low and the urgency to deploy the software is minimal, there is no justification for bypassing rigorous review standards. Thus, any software developer who finds themselves in this scenario should abide by the principles outlined in the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice and ensure that any code goes through rigorous testing protocol, no matter how sure they are of its impact, connections, or correctness.

"The Dangers of Chinese Childhood Neglect	
	In the new era of globalization, it’s expected that people respect different culture’s beliefs, values, and practices. However, oftentimes this standard is hard to uphold when separate cultures hold the belief that their practices are superior to others and their values are the important ones. This conflict is especially apparent in Chinese Americans and other people from multicultural backgrounds, where the values they’ve been taught growing up sometimes come into conflict with the traditional values their family holds. While both the Chinese and mainstream American approaches to parenting have their merits and demerits, I would argue that due to the Chinese approach’s unique sense of boundaries, their idealization of emotional suppression, and the rigid, uncomfortable expectations set for men and women, the American approach is often more conducive to raising a mentally healthy child.
	Traditional Chinese culture often views emotions as a hindrance and holds highly the idea of emotional discipline and holding in your emotions to show respect for your elders and your family. Here, family is held in high regard and every action is not only a reflection of yourself but also on your parents who raised you and your family. Tung describes this phenomenon, how children are “taught to get along, to place others' needs before their own"" and how they are often told to ""ting hua, literally, to listen to the speech (of an adult)"". (Tung 42) However, children raised in this way will often bottle up their emotions out of fear of punishment and social anxiety, something that Wang notes will “pollute our emotional water system, which wreaks havoc on all parts of our psychological and physical health.” (Wang 31) This is more than just a prediction, but the reality of children raised in this manner.  I witnessed this first-hand, watching my talkative and emotional sister be reprimanded for not falling in line while I was praised for being a quiet and obedient child, yet after growing up all I was left with was an empty detachment from my family and my emotions. In addition to emotional discipline, the Chinese approach to boundaries also shapes how children relate to their family and society. However, these boundaries can lead to further strain for them, through the pressure of their expectations.
The Chinese view on boundaries is that the family and place in society are just as important an aspect of a person as their autonomy. It can be argued that this concept of boundaries leads to a more deeply connected family structure compared to the Western version. But I would also argue that these boundaries also place an enormous burden on children during their development. The emphasis that the Chinese place on the family over the individual can lead to many scenarios where the child ignores their own needs or desires for maintaining the family line, especially in the case of marriage. This can be seen in Tung’s description of Family Wedding, a film about how a gay Chinese-American son tries to cover the fact that he was gay when his parent came to visit even though the father knew all along, and how “he went along with the ‘game’ just to get a grandson. He achieved his goal. To continue the family line is much more important to the father than his son’s sexual preference.” (Tung 16) However, children are ill-equipped to bear the weight of a whole family’s expectations, and it leads to an immense feeling of pressure and fear of failure. There are many examples of Chinese students tragically deciding to take their own lives after failing exams, such as university entrance exams, a direct result of this philosophy. And unfortunately, due to the Chinese view on gender roles, the rates of these suicides are greater for women than men. 
Gender roles have always existed in our societies, no matter the time or place. However, I would argue that the Chinese emphasis on family and society helps create a more constrictive and archaic sense of gender in comparison to other modern societies. While many patriarchal societies expect women to be mothers and men to be household providers, the emphasis on the role in the family setting causes many to feel trapped in their role for the sake of the family. At least in Western culture, women can be valued for their accomplishments despite living in a patriarchal society, whereas in Chinese culture a woman’s value stems from the family and not from her own worth. One of the greatest examples of this can be seen in how daughters are told by their mothers that “the absence of talent is a virtue for a woman.” (Tung 51) These beliefs lead to parents and families having a preference towards sons versus daughters, especially given that men are the ones who can “extend” the family line. Tung notes how in several studies, women in universities often wish they were men and that women have higher suicide rates than men, something that is a direct result of Chinese culture's preference for men and their expectations for women. 
	Ultimately, while the Chinese approach to parenting fosters a deep connection between family members and instills respect, its rigid expectations of emotional suppression, boundaries, and archaic view of the role of gender will come at the expense of a child’s mental well-being. This often leads to pressure and burdens that the children cannot and should not bear, and it’s important to acknowledge these demerits from Chinese culture. While no society may raise children perfectly, I believe that a more balanced approach that incorporates the deep familial connections of Chinese culture with the emotional expression and autonomy of Western culture may be a better path to raising the next generation."
"The All Revealing Mirror: The Use of Setting in Feminist Works
	If literature were a play, the setting would be the backdrop. But the setting of a story is far more than just the background of which the characters dance, it often plays a crucial role in shaping the overall theme and understanding of the text. Careful examination of the setting can often reveal the author’s intent in writing the story, as well as provide insights into the underlying messages of a story and general emotions in the story. However, one of the most important things that the setting can do for a story is act as a mirror, reflecting the characters' internal world. This becomes evident in Ernest Hemingway's ""Hills Like White Elephants"" and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper”, which despite using the setting in very different ways, still allows for deeper insight into the characters’ unsaid feelings and internal conflicts. 
Ernest Hemingway's ""Hills Like White Elephants"" is set at a train station in Spain against the backdrop of a barren landscape. On one side of the train station are the white hills, filled with life, while on the other is a barren valley. The story is centered around the couple’s conflict, only referred to as the “girl” and the “American” contemplating a procedure heavily implied to be an abortion. The setting of the train station symbolizes how the characters are at a crossroads in their relationship, contemplating a life-changing decision, and the transient nature of the train station reflects their uncertainty about the future. The setting amplifies the tension and unease between the characters, underscoring the weight of the decision they must make. Hemingway makes this especially clear in his description of the girl’s perspective on the white hills. “ Across, on the other side, were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the Ebro. Far away, beyond the river, were mountains. The shadow of a cloud moved across the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees.” (Hemingway 231) She not only sees the looming white hills, but also the vibrant fields and mountains beyond them, unearthing her true desire for family and a future with this man. This demonstrates how even though it might be difficult to understand how she feels about the situation at face value, with a thorough analysis of the story's setting, we can unveil the girl and the American’s motivations and feelings despite the conversation being very passive-aggressive, with neither side stating their true thoughts.
In Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper,"" the setting plays a central role in conveying the protagonist's mental state and the oppressive nature of her environment. The story is set in a colonial mansion, where the protagonist, suffering from postpartum depression, is confined to a room with yellow wallpaper. The setting of the mansion, with its isolated atmosphere, reflects the protagonist's internal sense of confinement and entrapment. The yellow wallpaper in the room becomes a symbol of the protagonist's deteriorating mental health and her growing obsession with freedom. As she becomes increasingly fixated on the wallpaper, the setting manifests her inner turmoil and descent into madness. As a reflection of the protagonist's internal world, as that world changes, so does the setting to reflect that. If the setting is interpreted in the sense that it is how the character personally sees the world, the outcome becomes more profound. Originally, she thinks little of the wallpaper in the room, almost disgusted with the sickly color. But throughout the story, she becomes more and more obsessed with it, seeing patterns in it and, eventually, a woman trapped behind it. It becomes a prison within a prison, symbolizing the protagonist's isolation and confinement within her own mind. In the end, she even believes herself to be the woman trapped behind the wallpaper, wondering “if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?” (Gilman 656) She refers to her hallucinations of the other creeping women outside, reflecting her desire to escape her “yellow wallpaper,” the room itself, and how she feels once she finally believes to have escaped it. Gilman has written “The Yellow Wallpaper” in such a manner that a reader not paying close attention to the details of the setting wouldn’t understand the contents of the story or be able to follow the protagonist’s descent into madness. Only through careful analysis of the setting does Gilman allow the readers to witness the effect of the horrific treatment of the woman in full.
 ""Hills Like White Elephants"" and ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" demonstrate how the setting can provide insight into the mood, tone, themes, and most importantly, the character’s thoughts. In Hemingway's story, the train station being at the border between the barren valley and lush hills reflects the conflict experienced by the characters, while in Gilman’s story, the oppressive setting of the yellow wallpaper room symbolizes the protagonist's mental confinement and struggle for freedom and independence. Furthermore, the settings of both stories contribute to a deeper understanding of the misogynistic society at the time and how the characters lived in it. In ""Hills Like White Elephants,"" the characters' inability to communicate effectively and come to a decision in the form of the train station. In ""The Yellow Wallpaper,"" the protagonist's confinement within the oppressive setting of the mansion reflects the societal constraints placed on women and their struggle for agency. The settings serve as more than just a backdrop for the narratives; they actively shape the characters' experiences and influence the direction of the stories. By examining the significance of the setting in these two works, we better understand how the environment the author tells the story is as much a part of the character as their dialogue or internal monologue is. 
In conclusion, the settings of ""Hills Like White Elephants"" and ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" play a crucial role in shaping the overall meaning and understanding of the texts, albeit in different means. Through their respective settings, Hemingway and Gilman effectively convey themes of confinement and the experience of women in a patriarchal society and offer readers hidden insights into the characters' experiences, thoughts, emotions, and the social contexts in which they exist. By analyzing the significance of setting in these two literary works, we gain a better appreciation for how setting can enhance our understanding of a text as a whole, as well as things to look out for in future readings. The settings of these stories serve as more than just the stage the characters dance upon; they are integral components of the characters, often packed with symbolism and meaning for their internal world that couldn’t be said explicitly. By paying close attention to the settings, readers can uncover layers of significance and gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the human experience depicted within these works."
"Storytelling: The Basis for Success in Human Society
	Without this essential human skill, society as we know it today would not exist. Humanity might never develop interpersonal bonds and complex cooperation. There’s a great possibility humanity would not survive into the modern day, or at least we would lose what makes us distinct from the other species on this planet. Of course, this vital skill is the ability to tell stories. Storytelling is often overlooked as mundane and irrelevant, especially by close-minded scholars who would proclaim that it serves no purpose in the reality of numbers. The idea that storytelling is impractical in real world circumstances is a close-minded conclusion, because upon further thinking, storytelling is one of the most important skills anyone can learn due to its underlying use not only in various job fields but in our day to day lives.
	Oftentimes writing and storytelling is looked down upon as not being useful in other job fields. However, these skills are indispensable due to how they can improve persuasive skills and the ability to effectively communicate their ideas with others. This is highlighted in Bronwyn Fryer’s article “Storytelling That Moves People”. In this article Fryer of Harvard Business Review consults renowned screenwriter Robert McKee over the purpose of storytelling and how it can be used to persuade others. McKee recalls particularly how “cognitive psychologists describe how the human mind, in its attempt to understand and remember, assembles the bits and pieces of experience into a story, beginning with a personal desire, a life objective, and then portraying the struggle against the forces that block that desire. Stories are how we remember; we tend to forget lists and bullet points.” The human mind innately has a hard time retaining raw information provided to it and unconsciously it arranges information in a story-like format to make it more digestible(Fryer). Storytelling is such an innate skill that the human mind has it built in to determine what information is important. Considering this concept, it becomes clear that storytelling is an incredibly important skill, especially in fields like business, where being able to convey your point clearly and memorably to clients and audiences is key. Those without the ability to storytell will be sorely lacking in their ability to capture the hearts of their listeners and get them thinking about the information presented. 
	However, for students in STEM these examples might still seem impractical. Storytelling might have its uses when it comes to business-like fields, but technical majors would spend most of their time doing calculations and research. They might claim that in their fields, storytelling doesn’t have any application and that they’re wasting their time learning these skills through English class. But you don’t have to be a businessman presenting a proposal to the board of directors or an engineer outlining their project designs to make use of storytelling skills. Storytelling is essential because it is the foundation of our ability to communicate with others. Frank Tallis goes in depth about the role storytelling plays in interpersonal bonding in his article “Why Stories Makes Sense of Our Lives (and Relationships)”. In said article, Tallis details the role storytelling has played in human history and how our traditions have changed over time from our ancestors long ago to the rituals of the more recent eras. He also notes how deep storytelling goes when it comes to human behaviors, and explains how when “old friends reminisce, they repeat stories and recycle shared experiences. A friendship group is often defined by its stories, many of which, if recounted while imbibing alcohol, are exaggerated for humorous or dramatic effect. Stories are entertaining. But they are also an affirmation of identity and belonging.” Tallis recognizes how when friends get together, a lot of the bonding they do is through storytelling, whether that’s through explaining recent events in humorous ways or recalling past stories that they’ve bonded over. While storytelling is useful when it comes to telling compelling arguments and making information easy to digest, the role it plays in our day to day lives is equally if not as profound. Tallis believed storytelling provided much more than entertainment; the sense of belonging and bond that stories among friends is a key part of how we develop relationships. Due to its role in creating bonds with others, those who lack or possess weak storytelling skills might find it difficult to navigate social relationships, emphasizing the importance of retaining knowledge of these skills from English classes.
	There’s no understating how essential the ability to storytell is for our society. It’s a key skill for professional careers, as the ability and sway and connect with your audience is necessary for almost any field. Storytelling helps us connect with other humans and it’s possible that without this important skill, people grow emotionally stunted, unable to communicate with others and relate their ideas with others. Without storytelling to help empathize with others and pass down information and culture to future generations it’s hard to imagine what humanity might look like today. Perhaps we would still be foraging in the wild for food in isolated groups, blissfully unaware of the endless possibilities that only the power of storytelling allowed us today."
